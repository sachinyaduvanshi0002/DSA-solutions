### 📜 Problem Description

Given an array  **arr[]**  of  **distinct** elements, which was initially  **sorted in ascending order**  but then  **rotated**  at some unknown pivot, the task is to find the index of a target  **key** .  If the key is not present in the array, return  **-1** .

**Examples :**

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3], key = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: 3 is found at index 8.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 1, 2], key = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no element that has value 6.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [33, 42, 72, 99], key = 42
Output: 1
Explanation: 42 is found at index 1.
```

**Constraints** :
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
0 ≤ key ≤ 106
